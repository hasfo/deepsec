DeepSec: Hybrid AI-Powered Security Auditor
DeepSec is an advanced security auditing platform that combines Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with the reasoning power of Llama 3.3 (Large Language Models). It is designed to scan local source code and GitHub repositories to identify vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10:2025.

##  Features at a Glance

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid Analysis** | Combines fast Regex patterns with Deep AI reasoning. |
| **GitHub Integration** | Automatically clones and audits remote repositories. |
| **Multilingual** | Full support for **English**, **Русский**, and **O'zbek**. |
| **PoC Generation** | AI generates Proof-of-Concept exploits for confirmed bugs. |
| **Smart Reporting** | Generates interactive HTML reports with remediation steps. |

GitHub README fayli uchun ushbu qismni yanada tushunarli va tayyor buyruqlar (copy-paste) bilan boyitilgan holda tayyorladim. Bu foydalanuvchiga terminaldan chiqmasdan sozlash imkonini beradi.

🔑 How to Get and Configure your API Key
To enable the AI-powered audit (Llama 3.3), you must obtain a free API key from Groq Cloud. Follow these steps:

1. Obtain the Key
Visit the Groq Cloud Console.

Sign up or Log in using your account.

On the left sidebar, navigate to "API Keys".

Click the "Create API Key" button.

Give it a descriptive name (e.g., DeepSec-Auditor).

Copy the generated key immediately (it won't be shown again).

2. Configure via Terminal
You can quickly set up your environment by running one of the following commands in your project root:





# Create a .env file and add your key
```bash
echo 'GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"' > .env
# Verify the file was created

cat .env
```




### Custom Modules

```bash
# List available modules
./physical.sh --list-modules

# Load custom module
./physical.sh --load-module tools/custom_module.py

# Run with specific tools
./physical.sh --tools "recon,enum,extract"
```

### Output Options

```bash
# Save results to file
./physical.sh --output results.txt

# JSON format
./physical.sh --format json --output results.json

# Verbose mode
./physical.sh --verbose

# Silent mode (logs only)
./physical.sh --silent --log-file operation.log
```



### Module Structure

Each module follows a standardized structure:

```python
class CustomModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Module Name"
        self.version = "1.0"
        self.author = "Your Name"
    
    def run(self, args):
        # Module logic here
        pass
    
    def cleanup(self):
        # Cleanup operations
        pass
```

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Edit `settings/config.conf`:

```ini
[General]
debug_mode = false
log_level = INFO
output_dir = ./output

[PDF-Robber]
extract_embedded = true
analyze_javascript = true
max_file_size = 50MB

[Network]
timeout = 30
retry_attempts = 3
user_agent = Custom-Agent/1.0
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
export BUTCHER_HOME=/path/to/butcher
export BUTCHER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.conf
export BUTCHER_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

## Available Modules

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| pdf-robber | PDF analysis and extraction | Active |
| network-recon | Network reconnaissance | Active |
| system-enum | System enumeration | Active |
| data-extract | Data extraction utilities | Active |

- Use shellcheck for bash scripts
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation
- Test thoroughly before submitting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Setup script fails:**
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

**Module not found:**
```bash
./physical.sh --list-modules
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Permission denied:**
```bash
# For authorized testing only!
sudo ./physical.sh
```
